            <p>
                My very first time working with code was in highschool where we done very basics of HTML. It was then, that I decided that this is the career path that will follow and grew into a passion from there. I've gone to study at Nelson Mandela Univercity as a Software Developer Student. 
                During my three years at NMU we worked with a few languages including HTML, CSS, C#, C++, PHP, Javascript and SQL. Our main focus were HTML, CSS and C# and and also worked with SQL. Javascript was lightly touched and we also worked with PHP for a short time. During there 3 years, I've done both the back end and front end of the projects we worked on. 
                After my graduation from NMU, with a National Diploma in IT: Software Development, I worked at a PC Repair company where I gained the skills in trouble shooting both Hardware and Software issues. During my time with compony, I've also helped in the adminastraion and sales departments where I gained the relevant skills in those areas. 
                From there I moved to a new compony installing wireless internet for client. I worked with multiple network equipent and learened how to install and setup the hardware and software. I also worked with winbox, required for the main setup of most installations done and helping client remotely if any issues accured with the network. 
                I got my first web-orientaded job in 2025 where I worked for a retail company. I created product overview and mostly used HTML. I got introduced to Tailwind Style Framework and build my skills within this framework. I later also started to implementing a combanation of Tailwind and CSS to make all overviews look as professional as possible.
